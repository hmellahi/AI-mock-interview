const TELL_ME_ABOUT_YOURSELF = `Firstly, I'd like to thank you for considering me for this interview.

I have 2 years of experience as a frontend developer.

I started learning to code back in 2019 when I was in high school. Following that, I pursued my education at 1337, a unique software engineering school. 1337 follows a peer learning approach, meaning we didn't have teachers. Instead, we were teaching each other to complete different school projects, and I also did some freelancing on the side.

While I was in school, I received an offer from Leyton as a software developer because I was one of the top students in my school, so I joined Leyton as an intern. After completing my internship, I received an offer as a Full Stack Engineer. Due to my commitment and hard work, I was then promoted to an intermediate position within just one year.

During my spare time, I was part of the founding team of Fileqa, a platform that instantly provides users with insights from documents, and we managed to have more than 100 users after our launch.`;
